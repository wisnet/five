## 3.1.0 (Unreleased)

### Enhancements

- The module has been internally refactored to use [Tannin](https://github.com/aduth/tannin) in place of [Jed](https://github.com/messageformat/Jed/). This has no impact on the public interface of the module, but should come with considerable benefit to performance, memory usage, and bundle size.

## 3.0.0 (2018-09-30)

### Breaking Changes

- `getI18n` has been removed. Use `__`, `_x`, `_n`, or `_nx` instead.
- `dcnpgettext` has been removed. Use `__`, `_x`, `_n`, or `_nx` instead.

### Bug Fixes

- The initialization of the internal Jed instance now correctly assigns its default data.

## 2.0.0 (2018-09-05)

### Breaking Change

- Change how required built-ins are polyfilled with Babel 7 ([#9171](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/9171)).  If you're using an environment that has limited or no support for ES2015+ such as lower versions of IE then using [core-js](https://github.com/zloirock/core-js) or [@babel/polyfill](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/next/babel-polyfill) will add support for these methods.
