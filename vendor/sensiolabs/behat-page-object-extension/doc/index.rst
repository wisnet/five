Page Object Extension
=====================

This Behat extension provides tools for implementing page object pattern.

Page object pattern is a way of keeping your context files clean
by separating UI knowledge from the actions and assertions.
Read more on the page object pattern on the
`Selenium wiki <https://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/PageObjects>`_.
