## 2.3.3 (Unreleased)

### Bug Fixes

- `addQueryArgs` will return only the querystring fragment if the passed `url` is undefined. Previously, an uncaught error would be thrown.

## 2.3.2 (2018-12-12)

## 2.3.1 (2018-11-20)

### Bug fixes

- The `isValidProtocol` function now correctly considers the protocol of the URL as only incoporating characters up to and including the colon (':').
- `getFragment` is now greedier and matches fragments from the first occurence of the '#' symbol instead of the last.

### Breaking Change

- Change how required built-ins are polyfilled with Babel 7 ([#9171](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/9171)). If you're using an environment that has limited or no support for ES2015+ such as lower versions of IE then using [core-js](https://github.com/zloirock/core-js) or [@babel/polyfill](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/next/babel-polyfill) will add support for these methods.
