The most likely reason for these message is that you have used the bundled `sensiolabs/behat-page-object-extension` package in a custom Behat context, but have not set up `setPageObjectFactory()` before you've tried to use it. Refer to WordHat's own codebase, or the `sensiolabs/behat-page-object-extension` package's documentation.
