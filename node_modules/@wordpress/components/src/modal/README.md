# Modal

The modal is used to create an accessible modal over an application.

**Note:** The API for this modal has been mimicked to resemble [`react-modal`](https://github.com/reactjs/react-modal).

## Usage

The following example shows you how to properly implement a modal. For the modal to properly work it's important you implement the close logic for the modal properly.

```jsx
import { Button, Modal } from '@wordpress/components';
import { withState } from '@wordpress/compose';

const MyModal = withState( {
	isOpen: false,
} )( ( { isOpen, setState } ) => (
	<div>
		<Button isDefault onClick={ () => setState( { isOpen: true } ) }>Open Modal</Button>
		{ isOpen ?
			<Modal
				title="This is my modal"
				onRequestClose={ () => setState( { isOpen: false } ) }>
				<Button isDefault onClick={ () => setState( { isOpen: false } ) }>
					My custom close button
				</Button>
			</Modal>
			: null }
	</div>
) );
```
