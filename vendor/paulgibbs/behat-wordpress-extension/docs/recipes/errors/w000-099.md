description: WordHat error code documentation for internal driver errors
# Error codes W000-099

These errors should only appear if you have added a custom driver to WordHat, somehow adjusted the bundled drivers' initialisation or bootstrapping processes, or asked a driver to do something it does not support.

## W001
> No ability to (...). Maybe use another driver?

The current driver does not support the requested action. A fix is to use another driver.

## W002
> [W002] Driver '(...)' is not registered.

WordHat could not find the requested driver. Check your `behat.yml` for typos.
